# My Turkish Music Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the My Turkish Music Analysis project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the emotional aspects of Turkish music through data analysis. Leveraging the My Music dataset, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and characteristics related to the expression of emotions in various Turkish musical compositions.

## Research Question

The central research question guiding this analysis is: "How do different acoustic features contribute to the expression of emotions in Turkish music?" By delving into the acoustic attributes of the selected Turkish music dataset, we aim to understand the intricate relationship between musical elements and emotional responses.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/862/turkish+music+emotion). It comprises a collection of Turkish music tracks, each labeled with specific emotional categories.

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis utilizes a range of tools and technologies, including:

- **Python 3**: The programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library.

## Structure

The project is organized into several sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the chosen dataset and the research question.

2. **Data Summary**: Explains data acquisition, provides a summary of attributes, and performs basic exploratory data analysis using Python.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides summary statistics for each attribute and includes graphical analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. **Inference**: Performs analysis to answer the research question, including visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn. This section likely involves machine learning models and cross-validation.

5. **Conclusion**: A concise narrative explaining the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
